Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]  // sorted array
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
//CODE


// time complexity O(1N)
//space complexity O(1)
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = nums.length-1;

        while(mid <= high){
            if(nums[mid] == 0 ){
                //swap with left
                swap(nums,low, mid );
                low++;
                mid++;
                // swap with right
            }else if(nums[mid] == 2){
                swap(nums, mid, high);
                high--;
            }else{
                mid++;
            }
        }
    }

    public static void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j){
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }
}
